# excelcomparison

I am trying to compare the multiple sheets of the two excel files, for which we will be getting our output in the console window, it will compare the data of both the files and if there is any mismatch it will guide you towards the position of the cell for the mismatch.

# Requirements

- Visual studio code
- nodeJS

# Install

We need to install libraries like exceljs and xlsx in npm.
